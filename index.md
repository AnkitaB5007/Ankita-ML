Welcome to my ML Blog !

I like to read scientific papers related to Natural language processing,
and most importantly, document them as a blog as I am too lazy to use a pen and a paper. 
The blog is not meant to be math-heavy or dangerously spooky with corollaries and theorems, 
rather an overview and meant to be consumed as a remainder tonic for an average brain like me.
If you have an IQ over 150 ;) Just leave me ALONE!!!!

Welcome to my ML Blog !

I like to read scientific papers related to Natural language processing,
and most importantly, document them as a blog. The blog is not meant to be 
math heavy or research based rather an overview and meant for basic understanding 
of a normal student, who likes such stuff.
Unless you have an IQ over 150 ;)
